        My ultimate goal is to build great products. <br/><br/>
        As a software engineer by training, I started my career building my own startup.
        After that, I spend my time mostly building apps for other startups. <br/><br/>
        I came to the conclusion that a successful app needs 2 factors: <br /><br/>
        <div style={{fontWeight:600}}>Great Engineering and Great Product Execution. </div> <br/>
        As someone who enjoys learning a wide range of topics and understanding the big picture, I often dabble in both engineering and product management to build truly great products. <br/><br/>
        Staying true to my goal and my roots as a software engineer, I hope to build great engnineered products to solve real problems.
