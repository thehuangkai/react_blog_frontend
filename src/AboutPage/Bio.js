        My ultimate goal is to build great products. <br/><br/>
        As a software engineer by training, I started my career building my own startup.
        After that, I spend my time mostly building apps for other startups. <br/><br/>
        I came to the conclusion that a successful app needs 2 factors: <br /><br/>
        <div style={{fontWeight:600}}>Great Engineering and Great Product Execution. </div> <br/>
        Nowadays, great engineering is more achievable than great product management, marketing and growth, which are much less predictable. <br/><br/>
        Staying true to my goal and my roots as a software engineer, I specialise in product management and software to build truly great products.
